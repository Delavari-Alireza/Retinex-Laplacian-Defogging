# Retinex-Laplacian-Defogging
An implementation of the Retinex-Based Laplacian Pyramid Method for Image Defogging, based on the IEEE paper. This project enhances foggy images using a combination of Multi-Scale Retinex (MSR), Laplacian Pyramid Decomposition, Bilateral Filtering, and Gamma Correction to improve visibility and restore lost details.
